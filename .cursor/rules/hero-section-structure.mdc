# Hero Section File Structure

The Hero section files are organized in `src/app/sections/Hero/` with the following structure:

## Directory Structure

```
src/app/sections/Hero/
  ├── landing-hero.tsx          # Main hero section component
  ├── background/
  │   └── AbstractBackground.tsx  # Abstract background component
  └── TextAnimations/
      └── VerticalText.tsx        # Vertical text animation component
```

## Import Paths

When importing Hero section components, use these paths:

```typescript
// Main hero component
import LandingHero from "@/app/sections/Hero/landing-hero";

// Background component
import AbstractBackground from "@/app/sections/Hero/background/AbstractBackground";

// Text animations
import VerticalText from "@/app/sections/Hero/TextAnimations/VerticalText";
```

## Notes

- The Hero section is located in `sections/Hero/` (capital H)
- Sub-components are organized in subdirectories (`background/`, `TextAnimations/`)
- Always use the full path `@/app/sections/Hero/` when importing
